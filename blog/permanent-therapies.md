# Permanent Therapies and Testing

### TMS Therapy
**Outcome:** Increased mood and lowered stress levels without pharmaceutical intervention
- **Duration of effects:** 1-2 years
- **Treatment course:** 2 months, 2025
- **Sessions:** 35 total
- **System:** Brainsway Model 102
- **Coil:** H1 (2 cm x 13 cm)
- **Site:** Left DLPFC
- **Motor threshold:** 49
- **Protocol:** Standard (120% MT) at 18 Hz, 55 trains, 1980 pulses
- **Theta Waves:** 10 sessions of Theta-Burst-Stimulation (80% MT) at 50/5 Hz, 20 trains, 600 pulses

### Rapamycin
**Outcome:** Studies show biomarker improvement in model organisms of a temporary therapy, however.
- **Treatment course:** 1 year (2023-2024)
- **Dose:** 2 schedules tested. (1) 6mg Sirolimus once weekly. (2) 1mg Sirolimus for 2 days, 0mg for third day.
- **Discontinuation:** Rapamycin was discontinued due to high cost, unusual side effects, limited medicine access, and inability to measure biomarkers closely enough.
- **Side Effects:** Slowed nail growth, slowed hair growth, increased acne. No persistent side effects after stopping treatment.

### Accutane
**Outcome:** Permanently reduced skin acne by ~80%
- **Treatment course:** 9 months (2017-2018)
- **Dose:** 20 mg/day oral isotretinoin, tapered up to 60mg/day after 3 months

### Genetic Tests

**Privacy Note:** For privacy and security reasons, genetic information is not directly disclosed.

- **Carrier and Rare Genetic Disease Screening:** Evaluated 500+ rare conditions to see what is autosomal recessive "carrier"
- **Psychotropic Medicine Genetic Screening:** Evaluates compatibility with hundreds of psychotropic medicines based on metabolization and genetic interactions
- **Geneaology DNA Test:** Lists regions of the world that your ancestors came from

### Completed Vaccinations
**Status:** Up to date with CDC schedule

- **Flu and COVID vaccines:** Receive annual flu and covid vaccines, choosing protein-based options
- **International travel vaccines:** Immunized for most travel-related infectious diseases and several vaccines approved only internationally

### Blood Tests
**Notable Results:**
- **Blood pressure:** 115/70
- **Creatinine:** Often elevated due to creatine supplementation
- **LDL cholesterol:** Often elevated (80-120 mg/dL) where optimal is <70 mg/dL
- **Kidney function:** Otherwise Normal
- **Liver function:** Normal

### Future Tests
- **DunedinPACE:** Measure rate of epigenetic aging, where 1 is population average, and 0.5 is record slowest
