### Rapamycin
**Outcome:** Studies show longevity benefits in model organisms after a temporary course of Rapamycin.
- **Treatment course:** 1 year (2023-2024)
- **Dose:** 2 schedules tested. (1) 6mg Sirolimus once weekly. (2) 1mg Sirolimus for 2 days, 0mg for third day.
- **Discontinuation:** Rapamycin was discontinued due to high cost, unusual side effects, limited medicine access, and inability to closely measure biomarkers.
- **Side Effects:** Slowed nail growth, slowed hair growth, increased acne, all ceased after stopping treatment.

### Accutane
